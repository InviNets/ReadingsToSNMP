DESCRIPTION:

The publish_sensor_readings.py script is designed to work
in pair with the InviNets ThermoMesh (TM) environment monitoring solution.

It converts raw readings from sensors to a standards-compliant
SNMP format.

An InviNets (TM) router can be configured to forward all readings
it receives from wireless sensors to a given IP address as UDP packets.
The publish_sensor_readings.py takes these packets and publishes their
contents using SNMP.

RUNNING THE SCRIPT:

To run the script, you must have:
 - a Windows or a Unix-compatible operating system (Linux, Mac OS X)
 - a configuration file for your InviNets ThermoMesh solution obtained
   from the InviNets support (contact support@invinets.com)
 - a python 2.x installation on your system
 - an SNMP reader application supporting SNMP v1 or SNMP v2

To run the script you must:

1) enter the invinets_snmp_publisher directory
2) from there, run ``python publish_sensor_readings.py config.txt'', where
   config.txt is the configuration file obtained from the InviNets website


CUSTOMIZING THE PORT NUMBERS:

Note that you can customize the ports used to receive the packets from
the InviNets router and publish the SNMP readings with command line flags.
Run python ``publish_sensor_readings.py -h'' for a full description.


SNMP DATA TYPES:

The readings are published with the standard LM-SENSORS MIB.
In particular:

lmTempSensorsDevice.N
lmVoltSensorsDevice.N
lmMiscSensorsDevice.N - gives the Asset Tag of the sensor nr. N. This
                        Tag is printed on the cover of each sensor.

lmTempSensorsValue.N - indicates the last temperature reading obtained
                       from sensor nr. N. The value is given in
                       milliCelcius.

lmVoltSensorsValue.N - indicates the last battery voltage reported by
                       sensor no N. The value is given in milliVolts.

lmMiscSensorsValue.N - indicates the last humidity reading obtained by
                       sensor no N. The value is an integer relative
                       humidity percentage (RHP).
